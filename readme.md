## Notes on running the model:
  1. Open model in NetLogo (2D or 3D)
  2. Go to interface tab
  3. Adjust sliders as necessary. The base case is (sliders from top to bottom, respectively): 50,000,000; 100; 2.0; 2.0; and 10.0
  4. Click setup
  5. Click "Go!" to run to tick 31 and click "Go once" to advance tick by tick
  6. Note that in NetLogo 3D, the visualization appears in a separate window

## Additional notes on the visualization
  - The large orange house represents the government, but they donot have any additional function in the visualization
  - The large yellow house represents the Port of Rotterdam and is where all pipelines either start or end
  - The grey lines are pipelines
  - The black x's are the storage points (randomly sprouted locations)
  - The small houses are randomly sprouted industries where:
    - Red indicates an industry with no intent to connect to CCS (and is not yet connected)
    - Yellow indicates an industry with intent to build but has not yet due to insufficent available capacity
    - Blue indcates an industry that has successfully connected to the CCS infrastructure
